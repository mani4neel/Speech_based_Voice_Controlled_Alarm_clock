    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 214101010_ DigitRecognition_HMM Project Overview
========================================================================
After extracting 214101010_ DigitRecognition_HMM.zip file, open -> 214101010_ DigitRecognition_HMM -> hmm folder

This folder contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up the hmm application. 

hmm.vcxproj :
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
hmm.cpp :
    This is the main application source file.

Cepstral_Coefficients.h : 
    This header file contains the functions for generating the cepstral coefficients of 20 utterances of 10 digit

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp : standard files

The following folders should be included:
1. Models : The final converged models are saved here
2. observation_sequence : the observation sequence of utterance of each digit is saved here
3. reference_files : All the cepstral coefficients are saved here
4. training_files  : All the utterances of digits are saved here.

prerequisite: To run this project, we need Microsoft Visual studio 2010 or higher.

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:
1. After extrating the zip file, make sure all the above files and folders are included in the parent folder.
2. Open the hmm.vcxproj file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. Open the hmm.cpp file from the Solution Explorer 
4. Press f5 to compile and run the project.
5. Perform the set of operations as mentioned in the console window.
